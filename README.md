## About

In this repository, you will find Rust implementations of solutions to LeetCode coding problems. Each solution is organized into its own file, named after the corresponding problem's title. The code is well-documented and includes problem descriptions as comments, making it easy to understand and navigate.

## Usage

To use the solutions in this repository, you need to have Rust programming language installed on your system. Once you have Rust set up, you can clone the repository and navigate to the specific problem's file you are interested in. Each file contains a standalone solution that can be compiled and executed independently.

To compile and run a specific solution, you can use the following command:

```shell
cargo run --bin <filename>
